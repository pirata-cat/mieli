# Mieli's design

## Core values

- We love the command line: admin tools must have always a CLI counterpart even if Django admin can be used.
- Keep it simple.
- Keep Django as it is: don't customize it.
- First, security. Second, convention. Third, beauty.
- Modularize all the things!
- Good code explains itself but awesome code has comments when needed.

## Bussiness

### Organizations

One organization has a site under one domain. Organizations can be grouped under meta-organizations, where user identifies as <user>@<domain>.

Organizations are composed by one or more groups. Groups can be hierarchical (with optional members "composition").

Every organization must be treated as external. Don't assume they may be hosted in the same instance.

## Technical

### Process architecture

Python can be a memory hog. As Mieli will become a core tool for liquid organizations, it must be cheap to deploy.

We don't want to develop it in Go, in order to allow more people to contribute, Mieli will work as a single process, with no limit for auxiliary processes (cache, database, queues, etc) neither for setting it up as a pool of workers (clone processes) for horizontal scaling.

Therefore we must take into account this in Mieli's features.

### Multiple sites

Mieli must support multiples sites, keeping them under a single process (or group of processes) but internally separated.

Django support sites with SITE_ID mechanism but it doesn't relate properly with User model. Also, we want to keep sites apart from each other: no sharing users, privileges or any other info. If we follow a "you have one user per instance" policy under a multisite setup, a malicious admin could log in a different site on the same system just changing a user's password associated to both.

At this point, we need a way to use Django's standard User model without customizing it. The "Simple Way" (TM) is to concatenate site's domain to the login name sent by the user.

In this way, organizations can freely assign usernames with custom policies and it even opens up federation in a easy way.
